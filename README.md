## Task 2: RISC-V Toolchain Installation 

- Compilation and Optimization: A C program is compiled using the RISC-V GCC compiler with the -O1 and -Ofast optimization flag to observe its performance and efficiency.

- Simulation with SPIKE: The compiled binary is executed in the SPIKE RISC-V simulator.

- Object Dump Analysis: The RISC-V object dump of the program is generated, showing the disassembled assembly instructions and memory addresses.
